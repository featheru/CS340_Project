# Beavers Development Real Estate Transaction and Rodent Database
### Winter 2022 
### Group Project: Jonathon Shea, Russell Feathers

### Project Technologies
FrontEnd: React  
BackEnd: NodeJS   
DB: MySQL  

### Project Description: 
Beavers Development is a large apartment complex of 50 floors boasting over 50 apartments per floor. Unfortunately, partially due to a large rodent infestation, the apartment complex undergoes quite a bit of tenant turnaround, with an average residency period of 2 years. To track the ~ 1250 apartment transfers each year, the complex requires a database that can store all of the information related to the owner, sale history, and apartments. The database will also include information regarding the ~20 current rodents living in the building and their locations to give insight into what apartments are likely to be sold due to rodents, and determine the cost incurred through apartment turnaround due to the rodent infestation. 

The database also holds data on previous residents, ~1250 new residents a year, previous rodents, ~ 10 leave the building each year, and purchase history of each apartment. The database plans to exist as long as the building is standing for ~100 years meaning it must hold up to 125,000 owner and purchase history entries, as well as  1,000 rodent entries
